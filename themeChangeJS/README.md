 # Explanation about the execution 
The provided JavaScript code is designed to respond to a keydown event on an input element with the id "themeUserInput". Here's an explanation of the code:

### Variable Declaration:

inputEl: Represents the input element with the id "themeUserInput".
bgContainerEl: Represents the element with the id "bgContainer".
bgContainerClass: Represents the class list of the "bgContainer" element.

### Event Listener:

An event listener is attached to the "keydown" event of the inputEl.
When a key is pressed and released, the associated callback function is executed.
Callback Function:

Inside the callback function, the value of the input element (changeColor) is obtained.
The condition checks if the key pressed is the "Enter" key and if the value of changeColor is "Dark".
### Changing Background Image:

If the condition is true, the background image of the element with id "bgContainer" (bgContainerEl) is changed using the style.backgroundImage property. The new background image URL is set to "https://d1tgh8fmlzexmh.cloudfront.net/ccbp-dynamic-webapps/change-theme-dark-bg.png".
### Adding a Class:

Additionally, a class "dark-theme" is added to the class list of bgContainerEl using bgContainerClass.add("dark-theme"). This class can be used for additional styling or other purposes.
